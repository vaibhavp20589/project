                        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her
                            artistry,
                            songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry and popular
                            culture. A
                            subject of widespread public interest, Swift is an advocate of artists' rights and has
                            had a
                            political impact.</p>

                        <p> Swift began professional songwriting at age 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in
                            2005
                            and
                            achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and
                            Fearless
                            (2008). Their singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me"
                            were
                            crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame.
                            She
                            experimented with rock and electronic styles on her next albums, Speak Now (2010) and
                            Red
                            (2012), respectively, with the latter featuring her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one
                            single,
                            "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift recalibrated her image from country to
                            pop
                            with
                            1989 (2014), a synth-pop album containing the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank
                            Space",
                            and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and
                            its
                            number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>

                        <p> After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover
                            (2019)
                            and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk
                            styles
                            on
                            the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and
                            re-recorded
                            four albums subtitled Taylor's Version[a] after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums
                            spawned
                            the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well",
                            and
                            "Is
                            It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023â€“2024) and its accompanying concert film became the
                            highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed
                            videos
                            and
                            films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short
                            Film
                            (2021).</p>

                        <p> One of the world's best-selling musicians, Swift has sold over 200 million records as of
                            2019.
                            She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and
                            Apple
                            Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. Six of her
                            albums
                            have
                            opened with over one million sales in a week. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift
